# Autodidacticism
A public repository for all of my self-teaching activities. 

## Plan each week
Each week, plan out the materials you wish learn. To ensure you don’t dive too deep into a single field, make sure you distribute your learning (somewhat evenly) across the several categories. For example, my current categories of choice include:
* Coding Theory
* Coding Practical 
* Design Theory
* Design Practical
* Freelance/Entrepreneaur

## Learning a Skill
Standardizing how your learn each skill will help you stay on schedule and manage your expectations.

Ideally, each skill you plan should take no longer then 5 hours. If it does take longer than a 5 hours then it should be broken up into smaller segments. 5 Hours is a good amount of time because it could mean an afternoon of heard work, easy two-day split, and hour a day, etc.

Each skill you choose to invest in should require the following items:
* Scope Assessment - Determine how much their is to learn and exactly what you want to focus on. Assemble materials.
* Notes - Take notes as you learn. Whether it’s practice code to follow along, a paragraph or two summary of what you’re reading, or points/flashcards of things to remember.
* Deliverable - A blog post, code sample, tutorial, file, ANYTHING that demonstrates what you’ve learned to the outside world
